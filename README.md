# Dev-Tool-Landing-Page---Cursor_a
desktop-first landing page inspired by Cursor, focused on replicating page structure, spacing, and visual hierarchy using pure HTML and CSS. No animations or interactivity included
Cursor Landing Page Clone

This project is a high-fidelity, desktop-first reconstruction of the Cursor landing page, developed as a technical assignment to demonstrate structural and visual accuracy using pure HTML and CSS.
1. Sections Recreated

To ensure the page mirrors the flow of a professional developer tool, the following sections were implemented:

    Top Navigation Bar: A sticky, frosted-glass header containing the Cursor brand logo, navigation links (Pricing, Forum, Changelog), and the primary "Download" CTA.

    Hero Section: The centerpiece of the page featuring a high-contrast gradient headline, product description, OS-specific download buttons, and a large product interface showcase.

    Trusted By / Logos: A minimal social proof section displaying a row of industry-leading company logos like OpenAI and Stripe.

    Feature Sections: A series of alternating blocks (text on left/image on right and vice-versa) highlighting "Chat with your Codebase" and "AI-Powered Refinement" using the provided UI assets.

    Final CTA Section: A high-impact closing section designed to convert users with a bold heading and "Get Started" button.

    Footer: A multi-column layout organizing company info, product links, and community resources.

2. Design System: Typography & Colors

The project adheres to the "Linear" design aesthetic, prioritizing readability and a premium "dark mode" feel.
Typography

    Primary Font: Inter (San-serif). This was chosen to match the modern, technical look of the Cursor brand assets.

    Headings: Utilizes a heavy font weight with tight letter-spacing (-1px to -2px) to create a professional, authoritative hierarchy.

    Body Text: Set in a legible grey (#888) to maintain a soft contrast against the dark background.

3. Technical Implementation

    Pure HTML/CSS: No frameworks (TailwindCSS) or JavaScript were used, ensuring a lightweight and clean codebase.

    Flexbox & Grid: Used for the navigation, feature alignment, and footer layout to maintain structural integrity.
